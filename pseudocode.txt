Hangman game psuedo code

set of words - dictionary
pick a word at random from the dictionary, remove that word from list for next game play
get length of word
length of word determines how many bad guesses the player gets
print out blank (underline) for each letter, print out number of losses and number of wins (zero initially)
ask player for a guess

if guess is one of the letters then replace the blank(s) with the letter(s), make sure to check for more than one instance of letter
if not a good guess then print the bad letter at the bottom of screen as a "bad guess" and subtract a play from the plays total

ask the player for another guess

If bad guesses get to zero then tell the player he lost and ask him to play again
add one to the lose score
If all letters get filled (length of word) before bad guesses reaches zero then congratulate player and ask him to play again
add one to the wins score

If all words get used up in the dictionary congratulate the player in a big way and game over.
